Welcome to HappyLift, an app that allows you to track your progress within your workouts. HappyLift features 23 exercises with pictures, as well as spaces
for you to document your max weight used, and your max number of reps attained.

In order to run HappyLift, download the zip file and unzip. Then, open the project in XCode, and press Ctrl+R to run the program. A simulator will show up
with the app's loading screen. You can then navigate through various exercises, either by scrolling or using the search bar. Click on an exercise that you would
like to view. You can now input the max weight used and the max reps done, press Save, and see your current max update. If you go back to the list of exercises
and click on the same exercises again, you will see your data saved. If you quit the app and reopen it, your current max will also still be saved,
so you can see your most recent workout's stats. You can also click the "Delete Data" button to reset all of the data.
